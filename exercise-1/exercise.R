# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in each game this
# season (google "Seahawks" for the info!)
pts.scored <- c(12, 3, 37, 27, 26, 6, 20, 31, 31, 26, 5, 40, 10, 24, 31, 25)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored
# against them in each game this season
pts.against <- c(10, 9, 18, 17, 24, 6, 25, 25, 24, 15, 14, 7, 38, 3, 34, 23)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
seahawks.scores <- data.frame(pts.scored, pts.against)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points.
# Hint: recall the syntax for assigning new elements (which in this case will be
# a vector) to a list!
seahawks.scores["diff"] <- pts.scored - pts.against

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won
seahawks.scores["won"] <- pts.scored > pts.against

# Create a vector of the opponent names corresponding to the games played
opponents <- c("Dolphins", "Ram", "49er", "Jets", "Falcons", "Cardinal", "Saints", "Bills", "Patriots", "Eagles", "Buccaneers", "Panthers", "Packers", "Rams", "Cardinals", "49ers")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
rownames(seahawks.scores) <- opponents

# View your data frame to see how it has changed!
View(seahawks.scores)
